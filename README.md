# nicodemus
Nicodemus bot - open source code

Nicodemus is a discord bot made for creating random tags using text files. To use the bot, just upload a text file and use the .t create [tagname] command to create a random tag! Then, whenever you use .t [tagname], the bot will pick a response at random from a line in the bots code.

The file keep_alive uses flask code to keep the bot running through a flask server in repl, while the main_code file is what actually runs the bot.

When adding the bot to a discord server using the link https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=976253629629599818&permissions=274878221312&scope=bot : please ensure that you allow the following permissions to the bot:

Use external emojis
Embed links
Attach files
Send Messages
Send Messages in Threads
Read Messages

ALL other permissions are optional, the bot only needs these 6 permissions to run.

If there are any issues with the code or bot, feel free to friend request and message LentilTea#4801 on discord!
