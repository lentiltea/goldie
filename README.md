# nicodemus
Nicodemus bot - open source code

Nicodemus is a discord bot made for creating random tags using text files. To use the bot, just upload a text file and use the .t create [tagname] command to create a random tag! Then, whenever you use .t [tagname], the bot will pick a response at random from a line in the bots code.

The file keep_alive uses flask code to keep the bot running through a flask server in repl, while the main code is what actually runs the bot.
